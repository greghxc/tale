## About Greg
I am a software developer living in Seattle, WA. I am enthusiastic about a
number of topics, including: cats, vegan food, bicycles, fiction, music, and
synthesizers.

## About HACKSY.ORG
Hacksy was created as a personal site for code snippets and photographs, mostly
of my cats. Hacksy is also an umbrella domain for a number of collaborative
resources used in various projects I've pursued outside of work.

## Theme Credit
This site was created using Jekyll and the
[**Tale**](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) theme.
